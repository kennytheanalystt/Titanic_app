      The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, 
      during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after 
      colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard,
      resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of 
      luck involved in surviving,
      it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
      This Full-Stack AI app was built based on a predictive Machine Learning Model that answers 
      the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data 
      (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
      The App is an AI application trained using Random Forest Classifie. The data-set trained was 
      gotten from Kaggle datasets(link below). The exploratory data analysis can be found in this  notebook(link below) and
       the codes can be found in this repository(link below)
