## ✅ Over-view
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. 

## ✅ Goal
This Full-Stack AI app was built based on a predictive Machine Learning Model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). The App is an AI application trained using Random Forest Classifier. The data-set trained was gotten from Kaggle datasets(link below). The exploratory data analysis can be found in this notebook(link below) and the codes can be found in this repository(link below)
